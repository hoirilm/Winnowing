The WebSocket protocol provides two-way realtime communication. However, by implementing the WebSocket protocol, security threats will be more numerous. One of the attacks that often occurs is packet monitoring carried out by irresponsible parties. To maintain the confidentiality and authenticity of data from the attack. One technique that can be used for data security is to apply the encryption method. In this research the encryption method used is Rivest Code 6 (RC6), the method has a high performance in the process using primitive operations, so it does not greatly affect the performance of the websocket protocol. The results of the avalanche effect trial showed that the total change for the Rivest Code 6 (RC6) algorithm based on the plaintext was 28.29% and based on the key was 52.28%. As for the Transport Layer Security (TLS), the total change obtained is based on the plaintext of 42.50% and based on the key 53.19%. The results of testing the speed of the delivery of messages obtained the average value of the overall time of sending messages amounted to 10673 milliseconds for Transport Layer Security (TLS) and 6964 milliseconds for Rivest Code 6 (RC6). The modified web library website is also capable of encrypted communication on the condition of the communication link with a packet loss probability level below 12%.
