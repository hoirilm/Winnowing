Arrhythmia is a disorder of the heart characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, becoming faster or slower. To diagnose Arrhythmias an Electroardiograph procedure is needed. The results of this Electrocardiograph procedure are Electrodiogram or commonly known as ECG. This ECG is then used as a reference for diagnosing Arrhythmias. ECG data has a large data size so that it requires a proper analysis process. Classification is one approach that can be done to understand the ECG data. One classification algorithm that can handle large amounts of data is Na√Øve Bayes. The number of features possessed by ECG data is a barrier in the classification process. Feature selection can be used to reduce features that are less relevant to the dataset. This study aims to determine the effect of feature selection on the performance of the Naive Bayes classification model in arrhythmia diagnoses. The results obtained from this study are the value of accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure has increased after applying feature selection. This is evidenced by the value of accuracy which increased by 4%, precision increased by 0.13, the value of recall increased by 0.13, the f-measure value increased by 0.14, and the computational time required is 0.03 seconds faster. The highest performance is obtained in the classification with 80 features. The accuracy is 93%, the precision and recall are 0.45, the f-measure is 0.42, and the computing time is 0.10 seconds.
