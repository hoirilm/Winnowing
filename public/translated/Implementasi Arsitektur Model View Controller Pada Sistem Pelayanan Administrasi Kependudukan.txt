Population administration services at the Kamal District Office are still using manual methods. This causes the administrative service process in the Kamal Sub-District Office to not be able to run efficiently. Therefore, we need a web-based Population Administration Service System application that is built with the Model View Controller architecture using the Codeigniter Framework. By using the MVC architecture there are several advantages between developing software for easy repair. By using MVC architecture, it can bring changes that make it easier on the population service process in Kamal sub-district, and can also shorten the service process time so that it can reduce the queue buildup while also being able to facilitate admin in the sub-district office in the process of finding population data residing in Kamal sub-district. The results showed that the implementation of MVC in the application of population administration service systems can be easily used and developed again.
