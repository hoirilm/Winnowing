The increasing number of vehicles, especially four-wheeled vehicles in big cities, has caused traffic problems, including toll roads. With a fast transaction process at the toll gate entrance, it can reduce the queue of traffic jams. For this purpose, an application for processing image recognition of vehicle number plates is needed. In this research, a number plate character recognition application is made in the vehicle image starting from the location plate detection process using background substraction. Furthermore, the segmentation process for each character and the last process is the introduction of character number plates using area-based features extraction. The data used in this study are 50 vehicle images, each of which has 3 distances, namely 50 cm, 75 cm and 100 cm. The results of this research trial show the best level of accuracy in scenario 1 with a distance of 50 cm with an accuracy of location plate detection accuracy of 94%, the best character segmentation accuracy of 89.58% and 82.59% for accuracy of character recognition.
