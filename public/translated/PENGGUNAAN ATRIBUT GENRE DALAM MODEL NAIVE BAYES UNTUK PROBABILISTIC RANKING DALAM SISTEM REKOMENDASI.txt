Recommendation system is a system created with the aim of providing an item recommendation to the user. One model of the recommendation system approach that is often used is Collaborative Filtering (CF), with an item-based approach. This model provides a pretty good recommendation, but the item-based CF does not utilize the item attributes in the calculation of its recommendations. Application of item attributes can be done in two ways, namely by one stage of modeling and two stages of modeling. One stage of modeling results in the quality of recommendations not too significant (not good). The second way is the two stages of modeling, candidate recommendations and the re-ordering stage. For example, the candidate recommendation stage uses a collaborative filtering approach, and re-ordering is done content-based or na√Øve bayes. In previous studies, the implementation of candidate recommendations using collaborative filtering, and re-ordering with Naive Bayes on data tagging resulted in good recommendations. Therefore in this study the author tries to apply the two stages of candidate ranking modeling with collaborative filtering, and re-ordering using nave bayes. with the case study of movie attribute genre in explicit (2-dimensional) data. From the experimental results get a pretty good value, with an increase in the value of accuracy generated by the NDCG evaluation method by 40.94486%.
