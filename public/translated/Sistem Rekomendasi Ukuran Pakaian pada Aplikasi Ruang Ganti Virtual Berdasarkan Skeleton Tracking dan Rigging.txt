The clothing business in the modern era is developing along with technological developments, it can be seen from the many shopping centers where there are several clothing stores. The number of clothing stores that exist, making shop owners compete to provide innovations that can attract potential buyers to buy their products, for example, provide promos or discounts so that potential buyers are interested. More and more potential buyers who are interested and visit to try on clothes, can cause queues in the dressing room which is usually in limited numbers. Therefore, the technology on the Kinect and Augmented Reality sensors is one of the right solutions to overcome these problems. With the use of the Kinect sensor an estimate of the width of the human back can be measured which can be used as a reference in choosing the appropriate size of shirt. Whereas through Augmented Reality technology, clothes are represented as virtual objects that can be added to the user's body without having to try clothes directly. From the results of this study, the average accuracy of the system for recommending clothing is 75%, while the system will be optimal in providing recommendations of 86% at a height of 75 cm Kinect and Kinect distance with users 200 cm, 225 cm and 250 cm. User Experience Survey with Likert Scale is 83.9% which shows that users are satisfied with the results of this study.
