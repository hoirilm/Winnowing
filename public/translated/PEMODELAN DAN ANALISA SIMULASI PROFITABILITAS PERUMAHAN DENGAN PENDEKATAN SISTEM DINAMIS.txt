The housing property business sector has a significant impact on the value of profits, this is evidenced through research in the field which shows that the costs required to build housing are quite large and take a long time. Increased consumer demand for housing also has an impact on increasing the value of profit, thus encouraging developers to add the type of housing that consumers are interested in.
To find out the increase in the value of profit, then made a system that is able to analyze the level of effectiveness and efficiency in estimating the value of profits obtained. The method used in making the system is simulation modeling and analysis with a dynamic system approach through several scenario models namely structure and parameter scenarios. Modeling is described in a causal diagram and then developed through a flow chart.
Based on the simulation results to increase profit value, it can be done by adding promo furniture variables that are applied to the structural scenario, while the parameter scenario there are three conditions including an optimistic scenario an increase of 34.6%, the most likely scenario shows an increase of 14.81% and the scenario pessimistic with an increase of 4.91% from the initial profit value. For housing types that have a high profit value, it is indicated by Cheryl type housing with a building area of ​​223 out of the four housing types in block Xa with an average profit of Rp. 24,222,060,000.
