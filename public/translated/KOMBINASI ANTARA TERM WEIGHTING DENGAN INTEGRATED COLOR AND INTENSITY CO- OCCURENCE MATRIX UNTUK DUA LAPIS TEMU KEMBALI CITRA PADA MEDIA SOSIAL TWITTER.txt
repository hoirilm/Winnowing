Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is one of the techniques used to search content-based images. Although the search results from CBIR are relevant to the query given by the user, sometimes the results are not what the user wants. So as to overcome these problems in this study two layers of retrieval systems will be used that combine text retrieval with the Vector Space Model (VSM) and weighting using Term Frequency - Inverse - Document Frequency (TF-IDF) combined with CBIR using Integrated Color and Intensity Co-Occurence Matrix (ICICM) as a feature extraction method for images. The features used in ICICM are texture and color which are two low-level features that are often used for image classification and retrieval. The purpose of this study is to combine the two layers of the retrieval system, namely text and content based to get better retrieval results. The data used in this study came from social media Twitter with a text query in the form of "Madura tourism". The results obtained from this study are that using a combination of text based with content based can improve the precision and recall of retrieval results even without searching in the entire dataset. The results obtained in this study are by using a combination of text based and content based, the results are better than using text based alone, with an increase of 0.0576 for precision and with the same recall. Whereas by using a combination of text based and content based the results are better than using content based alone, namely an increase of 0.0238 for precision and a recall of 0.2000.
