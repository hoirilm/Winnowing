Collaborative Filtering (CF) is the most widely used recommendation model by calculating the similarity between users and items. This model assumes that some people who like the same things tend to be equally like the other things, so the recommendations produced will be more varied. But CF has two main problems, namely sparsity and scalability. To overcome sparsity, it will fill in the blank rating matrix using the calculation of item similarity and item attribute similarity. Then solve the scalability problem by applying Fuzzy C-Means clustering so that the calculation process only processes items that are really similar in the same cluster. From the system implementation that has been done, the sparsity problem can be solved by calculating the combined similarity between item similarity and item attribute similarity with the density level that was originally from 5.04% to 100%. While the scalability problem can be solved by applying Fuzzy C-Means clustering with faster computing time of around 25.74%. Based on the f1-score evaluation value, CF Clustering produces the highest evaluation value of 5.434 and the Traditional CF model produces the highest evaluation value of 2.307. This shows that in this study the CF Clustering model produces recommendations that are better than the Traditional CF model.
