In this case the coach wants to know the extent of the physical condition of the players from each individual, by correcting the physical condition of a good volleyball player. To make it easier to find out the physical condition of the player, a decision support system is needed that can classify the player's physical condition. The method used in the decision support system is Naive Bayes. Naive Bayes is one of the methods in data mining to classify data.
