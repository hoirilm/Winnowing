Total Sport Convection in the production process uses a flow pattern that is flow shop (jobs that will be processed flowing in the same line or direction of production) and the company uses the rules of the First Come First Serve (FCFS). The FCFS method does not pay attention to the value of the makespan, this is not profitable for orders that require short processing time because if this order is behind an order that has a long run time, it has to wait a long time and cause the overall production time to be longer. This study aims to provide recommendations on scheduling work orders with minimum makespan values. Makespan is the total time needed for work completion starting from the first sequence done on the machine, or the first to the last Work Center. In this research, a production scheduling method is proposed by using a genetic algorithm that is used to minimize the makespan of scheduling, then a comparison between the makespan between FCFS method scheduling and Genetic Algorithm method is conducted. The fitness values ​​of the best individuals are monitored. For each generation with a different number of populations and the highest number of generations, the value of makespan is high, so the parameters used are: number of generations = 40, population size = 80, chance of crossover = 0.1 and chance of mutation = 0.001. Accuracy results with Scheduling Performance Parameters obtained 8.98% Genetic Algorithm is better than FCFS with minimum makespan from AG that is 67.60 hours, while makespan from FCFS method is 73.67 hours, there is a reduction of makespan by 6.07 hours.
