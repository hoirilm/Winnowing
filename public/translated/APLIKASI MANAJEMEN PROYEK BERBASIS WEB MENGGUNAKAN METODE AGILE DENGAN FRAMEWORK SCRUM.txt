The project is a complex business activity, is not routine, has limited time, budget and resources and has its own specifications for the product to be produced. In working on a project, it is necessary to have a foundation method used in project management. The method must be in accordance with the conditions encountered on a project. The problem that often occurs is that stakeholders tend to use traditional methods, assuming that the project undertaken will be in accordance with the needs that have been defined. Even though, in reality, what is happening on the ground, the possibility of technical changes in the project is very possible. In the traditional method, these changes are less able to be accommodated. Based on these problems, we need a method that is able to cope with changes that occur, so the results or products of a project can meet the wishes of the client. The method that is able to accommodate these changes is the Agile method. In this study, the author will build a project management application with the Agile method using the Scrum Framework. The results showed that the efficiency obtained from usability testing of project management applications has a value of 3.89 (77.8%). Indicates that the user is satisfied with the efficiency of the project management application.
