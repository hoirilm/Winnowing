The requirement for a motorized vehicle to operate in the city of Bangkalan is to pass the KIR test. During this time the KIR Test process is carried out using the KIR Test machine. However, the recording of the results of the KIR Test is still done manually. So it has several weaknesses, including the process of determining whether a vehicle is worthy or not for a long time and has not been computerized. To overcome these problems, an application was made to determine the operational feasibility of motorized vehicles in DISHUB Bangkalan by applying the concept of MVC (Model View Controller). The results of this study indicate that the application of the MVC concept in the vehicle test data management application is considered to be Good. This can be seen based on the results of the questionnaire calculations that have been carried out from 3 types of respondents, it can be concluded that the average percentage of achievement of the system that is equal to 98.76% declared appropriate and 1.21% stated inappropriate.
