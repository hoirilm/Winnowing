Based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO), Indonesia is a country that has the fourth highest mortality rate in the world caused by diabetes mellitus [1]. Diabetes mellitus is a disease that has several symptoms that must be watched out for, for example the number of pregnancy, glucose concentration and others. Of the many features that exist, there are several problems, one of which is the longer diagnosis process. The selection of features that are less relevant can be used to reduce the diagnostic time. The f-score feature selection can be used to reduce symptoms that are less relevant so that the time to diagnose is more effective and the accuracy is better. In addition to the selection of features, the classification of the disease can be done to find out whether the patient is positive for diabetes mellitus or negative for diabetes mellitus. C4.5 algorithm is a machine learning algorithm that can be used for disease classification and can find patterns from data. The purpose of this study is to measure the accuracy value resulting from diabetes classification using C4.5 algorithm with feature selection and without feature selection. f-score feature selection method and C4.5 algorithm with 80% of training data resulted in an accuracy value of 72.791% and precision 63, 924% and recall 51.208 with a time of 12.99s
