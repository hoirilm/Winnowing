The Bangkalan Regency Public Works and Spatial Planning Office (PUPR) is responsible for repairing district-level road damage. In handling there are several obstacles including limited funds from the central government and the large number of damaged roads. Therefore, research needs to be carried out to determine the priority of road repair by taking into account the existing criteria including the length of the road, the width of the road, the length of each condition (good, moderate, lightly damaged and heavily damaged). In this study two methods were combined: Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and the Simple Multi Attribute Rating Technique (SMART) Method. FCM method is a method that is able to group data based on its characteristics and SMART is a method that is able to solve problems with multi criteria. By combining the two methods in determining the priority of road improvement produces an accuracy rate of 80%. This accuracy value is obtained by analyzing the level of equation results of calculations made by experts in the Public Works and Bina Marga Office of Surabaya on the system that we created. Making this SPK has a level of conformity as what is desired by the user / user by 73.4% based on a questionnaire against 6 respondents.
