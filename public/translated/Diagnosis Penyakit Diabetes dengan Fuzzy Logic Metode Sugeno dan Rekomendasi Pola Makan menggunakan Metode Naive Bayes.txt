Diabetes is a disease caused by an increase in blood sugar in the body. Diabetes is a deadly disease whose number of sufferers continues to increase from year to year. This is due to late diagnosis and poor diet. This disease is characterized by a sustained increase in sugar levels especially after eating. So diabetics are highly recommended to adjust their diet according to the number of calories needed. Lack of community knowledge about nutrition becomes difficult for them in determining healthy eating patterns. Sometimes some people go on the wrong diet and result in worsening body health. For this reason, an application that can help diagnose diabetes and provide dietary recommendations is needed. The application was built with the implementation of the fuzzy logic Sugeno method and Naïve Bayes method. Fuzzy logic Sugeno method is used for the diagnosis of diabetes while the Naïve Bayes method is for dietary recommendations. The results of the implementation of the Sugeno fuzzy logic method in diagnosing diabetes, obtained an accuracy value of 76.67%. Thus the accuracy of the conversion results shows that the diagnosis is "good". Whereas for dietary recommendations, after 5 times the recommendation test was conducted, the average accuracy of 72% was obtained. Thus the implementation of the naïve bayes method in dietary recommendations shows that the results of the recommendations are "good".
