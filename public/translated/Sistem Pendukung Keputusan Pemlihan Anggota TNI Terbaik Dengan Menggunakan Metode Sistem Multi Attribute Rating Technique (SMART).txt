The assessment process of TNI members in Lanal Batuporon is still using the manual method, which is still quite slow and less modern. Therefore, we need the application of a decision support system for the assessment of the best TNI members using the Multi Attribute Rating Technique (SMART) method. By using this method, there are several advantages, namely the weighting of the criteria can be changed so that, if there are additional criteria can add weight according to the level of criteria to be weighted. In addition, the existence of this web-based application has another advantage in assessing without having to wait long because it uses a manual process which is at the time of the ranking process, without having to search for the highest value manually. However, ranking the results of the assessment can directly rank themselves according to the highest final value, and can speed up the process of the manual method.
