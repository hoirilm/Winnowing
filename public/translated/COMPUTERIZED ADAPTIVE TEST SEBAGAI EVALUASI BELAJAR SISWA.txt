Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) is a form of computer utilization for conducting adaptive tests in which questions given to students have been selected from the existing question bank. In adaptive tests, students who have high ability will be given difficult questions. While students who have low ability will be given easy questions. So students who are smart will be more challenged, and students who are less smart will not be depressed.
The addative test starts from a question with a moderate level of difficulty. if students can answer correctly, then the level of difficulty of the questions will be raised to the level of difficulty. conversely if students answer the questions wrongly, then the level of difficulty of students will be reduced to the level of difficulty that is easy. This adaptive test can be said to be effective in knowing students' abilities. this is evidenced by student trials and questionnaire results that show an average rating of 4.1 from the value of the range between 1 to 5 and included in the effective category
