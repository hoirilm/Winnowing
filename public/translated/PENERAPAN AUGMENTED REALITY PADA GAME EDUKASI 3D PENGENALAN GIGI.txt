Teeth are one of the vital organs in the body. That's because dental health can affect the quality of life of individuals. Teeth are very susceptible to interference, especially in adolescence. Therefore it is very important to introduce children to the procedures for caring for teeth from an early age to avoid disturbances in the future. To overcome this problem, then made a 3D educational game application that introduces the teeth and treatment procedures. This application applies Augmented Reality technology and is created using the Unity3D game engine with the addition of the LeanTouch library as an interaction between the user and the Augmented Reality object displayed. This educational game runs on an Android device. By using Augmented Reality technology and the LeanTouch library, making the application more interactive and will certainly be more interesting for users, especially children. This was evidenced by the results of the user experience test with the Likert scale calculation to get a total score of 570 from 20 respondents who have tried this application. In this research the Likert scale is used to measure the attitudes, opinions, and perceptions of users towards the application. From the total score, it can be concluded that the user understands the material presented in the application and the user feels very satisfied with this application and a very positive response.
