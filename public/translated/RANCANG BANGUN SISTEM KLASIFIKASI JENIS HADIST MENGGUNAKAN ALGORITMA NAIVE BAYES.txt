Hadith is a very calculated thing in Islam, because the Hadith is the second source of law after the Qur'an. However, currently there are many false hadiths circulating which incidentally can lead to understanding which is not in accordance with Islamic teachings. Therefore, this study tries to automate the assessment of the validity of a hadith by implementing the rules contained in ulumul al hadith which are then combined with the naive bayes classification method. This system is expected to be an initial reference in examining the authenticity of a hadith about whether or not it should be used as evidence before finally entering into more in-depth research. And this system also compares the classification results produced by the system with the actual classification results
