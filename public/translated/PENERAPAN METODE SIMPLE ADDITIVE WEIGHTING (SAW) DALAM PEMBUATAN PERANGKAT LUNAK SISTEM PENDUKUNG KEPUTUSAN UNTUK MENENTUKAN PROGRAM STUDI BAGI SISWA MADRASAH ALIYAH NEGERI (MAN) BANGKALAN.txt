The determination of study programs or majors is a very important issue for high school students because it can affect the smooth learning process and the selection of tertiary institutions. In Madrasah Aliyah Negeri (MAN) Bangkalan there are 4 study programs namely: Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, Language, and Religion Study Programs. At present, the process of determining the study program is still done manually by the Guidance Counseling teacher based on the report card grades and students' interests. This results in inaccurate results because judgments are subjective. An assessment based on formal information based on criteria needs to be done to get accurate and objective results. Determination of study programs is assessed based on 4 criteria, namely: academic grades or student report cards (the average value of class X semester 1 and 2 subjects related to each study program), the results of the majors questionnaire, knowledge tests (conducted online) , and the results of the psychological test. The four criteria are processed using the Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method. The results obtained from the system trial using 102 data are 78 data in accordance with current student major data and 24 different data, thus the corresponding data percentage reaches 76.5%.
