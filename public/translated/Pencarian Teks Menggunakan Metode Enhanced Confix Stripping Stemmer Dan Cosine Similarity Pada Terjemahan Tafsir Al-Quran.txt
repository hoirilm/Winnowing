Al-quran is a holy book that is a guide for the people
Islam. The Qur'an has also been translated into various languages
to make it easier to understand the meaning of each verse in the Qur'an. However, there are still many who do not understand the meaning of the translation of the verses of the Koran, so that we need a detailed interpretation or explanation. Along with the development of technology, many interpretations of the digital al-Qur'an have been equipped with a search system. However, there are still difficulties in finding an interpretation of the Qur'an in accordance with the topic or topic because one letter with another letter has similarities and differences in certain topics. Therefore proposed a text search system using Information Retrival that allows users to find information that is relevant or as needed. This research uses the Enhanced Confix Stripping Stemmer method which is used for the process of forming an accurate base word and the Cosine Similarity method to calculate the similarity of a query to the keyword query in the database. Based on the results of testing the system using Enhanced Confix Stripping Stemmer stemming obtained an accuracy value of 71.96% and a level of ability to retrieve all relevant verses (recall) 98.64%, while without using stemming an accuracy value of 82.95% and an ability level to take all relevant verses (recall) of 76.70%.
