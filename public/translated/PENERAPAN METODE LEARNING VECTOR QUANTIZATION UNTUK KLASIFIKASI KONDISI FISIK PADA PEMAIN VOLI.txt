Volleyball can be regarded as one sport that has complex movements. A volleyball player must work hard to improve his abilities with one of them in physical condition. In determining the physical condition can utilize computer science in providing solutions and decision support for volleyball players. By applying the learning vector quzntization method, it can classify the physical condition of a volleyball player. The learning vector quantization method itself is a Supervised Learning classification method. With this system, it can help the coach to find out and give the portion of training to players who have physical conditions divided into several categories, namely very good, good, enough, less, and very less so that the determination of the physical condition of players faster. Accuracy results obtained by the classification of physical conditions in volleyball players using the learning vector quantization method that is 95% with alpha 0.1 to 0.5 and epoch 5 to 40 obtained from the comparison of manual calculations with the results of the classification system.
