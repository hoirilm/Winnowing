Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) is a disease that can make a patient's body temperature very high and is generally accompanied by signs of symptoms such as headaches, joint pain, muscles, and bones, and pain in the back of the eye. Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever is caused by dengue virus which spreads through the bite of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. In this case, an accurate analysis is needed to minimize the diagnosis of errors that makes delays in handling. In this study, an Android-based expert system was made to diagnose DHF that aims as an early prevention. The expert system will provide a choice of dengue symptoms to be selected by the user. The symptoms that have been chosen by the user will be calculated using the Certainty Factor and Naive Bayes methods. With this system, it is hoped that it can help the wider community make a diagnosis of dengue faster. System testing is done using the K-fold cross validation method with a value of k = 3. Based on trials using the K-fold cross validation method, it shows that the Naive Bayes method is able to make a more accurate diagnosis than the Certainty Factor with the test results of 76.5625% and 70, 83333333%.
