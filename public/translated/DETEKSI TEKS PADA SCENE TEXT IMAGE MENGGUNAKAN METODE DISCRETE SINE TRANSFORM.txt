Text detection is the process of detecting text in an image, followed by surrounding it with rectangular boundary boxes. Text detection can be done using image based techniques or frequency based techniques. Many applications require the detection of text on images ranging from automatic detection of traffic signs that help in the transportation system, helping blind people and others. In this study the data used is a focused Scene Text dataset with images used in size 640 x 480 pixels with the format .jpg. The method used to detect text in images is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The use of the fast fourier transform method aims to minimize the memory requirements of digital images, and the extent to which the quality of a digital image is reduced and the file size if subjected to a compression process using the FFT method. The average results of this study are precision is 0.44, recall is 0.95 and f1 score is 0.55.
