The game is one of the entertainment media that is played by all walks of life from children to adults, especially online games. Online games are a type of game that is in great demand, this is the reason online games continue to be developed. In this research, an online game was developed by implementing the best maze generation algorithm and cloud storage for making maze games. The algorithms being compared are Binary Tree, Aldous-Broder, Hunt-and-Kill, Growing Tree, and Wilsonâ€™s. The best choice algorithm is applied to generate maze tracks while cloud storage is used to store player accounts, scores, and result games. In addition, this game is also made using WebGL for creating web-based objects. The maze comparison test results show that the fastest algorithm to create a maze is the Binary Tree algorithm with an average time of 5.13 milliseconds on a 30x30 maze size. In testing storage efficiency, cloud storage is more efficient than local storage, with an average time of 21.20 milliseconds.
