Employees are a very important asset in an organization. In order to reward and motivate existing employees, a system of promotion recommendations was made for the Bangkalan District Inspectorate Office's Functional Supervisory Office. This system is made using AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) calculation method. AHP produces a ranking obtained by comparing each criterion and also alternatives in this case prospective candidates who will be given a promotion. AHP is a method of making pairwise comparisons between selection criteria and also pairwise comparisons between available choices. The problem of decision making with AHP is generally compiled into criteria, and alternative choices. The results of the implementation of the AHP method in providing recommendations for incremental ranks, after 4 times the recommendation test was carried out, the average accuracy of 86.25% was obtained. Thus the implementation of the AHP method in the promotion recommendation shows that the recommendation results are "good".
