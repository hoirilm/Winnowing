Companies must be able to balance sugar production in accordance with market demand. Because, if sugar production exceeds market demand, it will cause accumulation and expenditure costs that exceed the limit. However, if the sugar production is too little the company is unable to meet market demand so as to reduce the company's opportunity for profit. For this we need a system that can later simplify the process of forecasting sugar production. The system was built using a comparison of 2 methods, namely the Single Exponential Smoothing method and the Backpropagation method. The purpose of this study is to determine the best accuracy results using the Single Exponential Smoothing method and the Backpropagation method in forecasting sugar production. The Single Exponential Smoothing and Backpropagation method is used to predict the amount of sugar production for the next one month based on the production data of the previous 5 months. From the results of tests that have been done, it can be seen that the Backpropagation method produces the smallest MSE and MAPE, amounting to 57187817.49 and MAPE of 1.019593892% compared to the Single Exponential Smoothing method with MSE of 83602989.43 and MAPE of 1.46412926%. So the most appropriate method for forecasting sugar production is the Backpropagation method.
