Sweet starfruit (Averhoa Carambola L.) is one
horticultural potential that is commercial in nature and has the opportunity as a source of income for the community. Many people who want to cultivate star fruit, but star fruit is very susceptible to plant-disturbing organisms this can make farmers have to think again. The main problem found in star fruit is the attack of fruit fly pests and fruit caterpillars that have almost the same symptoms, if not handled properly will result in undesirable effects such as crop failure so that it can result in reduced star fruit production. In this study using the Decision Tree C4.5 method. Decision Tree C4.5 method is a method used for classification based on tree branches or classification questions and leaves or called class. Accuracy obtained by the star fruit disease diagnosis system by testing the K-Fold Cross Validation to divide the data into 5 parts consisting of 160 training data and 40 testing data obtained the average value of accuracy using the Confusion Matrix method of 99.5%. The results of the calculation of the average F-Measure obtained accuracy and Recall accuracy of fruit flies by 99.62% and 99.62% for caterpillars. The feasibility level of modeling in the star fruit disease diagnosis system obtained an average value of accuracy of 94.57% which involved 6 respondents with 10 questionnaire questions.
