The ability of computers to identify pedestrian attributes receives great attention in computer vision research because of its high application, one of which is in the field of visual surveillance systems. The methods used by previous researchers still use handmade features (for example color histograms and local binary patterns) which take time because they have to find suitable features from the many features for the case at hand. This research proposes the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) method which has the ability to automatically perform feature learning (feature learning). CNN has several hyper-parameters whose values ​​affect classification performance, one of which is the number of convolution layers. In this study, several experimental scenarios were conducted to determine the effect of the number of layers on CNN performance. Several different CNN architectures were trained and tested using a PETA dataset that contained remote footage images. The results of the trials carried out, three CNN models with the number of convolution layers three, five and seven obtained an average f1 score of 56.76%, 59.60%, and 69.00% of the seven attributes identified, respectively. From these results it can be concluded that the more the number of convolution layers used, the better CNN performance.
