Salt is a strategic commodity, East Java Province is one of the largest national salt suppliers whose production centers are in Madura. Madura is an area that has the potential for salt production so that Madura has always been known as a salt island. However, salt ponds as a land for producing salt do not all have good potential because they have differences from the technical aspects that affect the productivity of salt ponds. To find out which salt ponds have similarities from technical aspects. Grouping is done by using cluster analysis. Cluster analysis is the grouping of objects into smaller groups where each group has similar objects to each other. the grouping process is done for salt ponds in East Java using the Single Linkage method. Single Linkage Method is a Hierarchy method that groups an object that has the closest distance first or the greatest similarity. This is influenced by distance calculation using Euclidian Distance and mapping utilizing Geographic Information System technology in spatial data of salt ponds. Clustering Using Single Linkage can be measured using the Silhouette Coefficient method. The results of this study indicate the value of 0.9361 Silhouette Coefficient in salt pond clusters in East Java Province with an accuracy value of 93.61% and categorized as strong structure
