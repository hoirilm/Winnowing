Image segmentation is the most important stage in
improve pattern recognition. Until now there has been no method
optimal segmentation for images with dynamic background.
Segmentation aims to divide the image procedure into
some basic parts of the image compiler. In this research
segmentation will only divide two parts of the image, i.e.
main object and background parts. The dataset used in
This study uses the Fish dataset. Preprocessing is done
first with the method of histogram equalization. Algorithm
Image segmentation that will be used in this research is
with the Fuzzy Partitions and fuzzy partitions methods. Fuzzy Method
Partitions are used for the segmentation process by dividing
partition on the image. Fuzzy Interpolations to improve quality
the result of segmenting the main object from a background. After
conducted research, segmentation of objects with dynamic background in this study shows an accuracy value of 99.60% using the fuzzy partitions and fuzzy interpolations methods.
