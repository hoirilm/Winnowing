Management of existing research data in LPPM is still manual. The process of taking the researcher biodata form and depositing the research file is still done manually. Therefore we need an application that can overcome these problems. The application to be developed is the Unified Process model using the Codeigniter Framework. Unified Process is a software development process developed by Ivar Jacobson, Grady Booch, and James Rumbaugh. The results obtained from the construction of this application the entire process of managing research data can be managed easily and quite effectively.
