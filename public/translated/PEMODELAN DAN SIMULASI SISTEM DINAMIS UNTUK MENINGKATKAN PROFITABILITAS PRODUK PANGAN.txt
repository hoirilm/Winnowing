In food production such as chip production, it will definitely experience ups and downs in product sales, this will certainly have an impact and affect the level of profitability of chips. To find out the profit value of food chips, a system can be analyzed. The method used in making the system is a dynamic system simulation method with 2 scenario models namely packaging and price, and material added scenarios. The results of the simulation of the material added scenario results in a decrease in profit ranging from -1.67 percent to -8.35 percent. The packaging and price scenario of profit increases ranging from -6.23 percent to 18.71 percent. For businesses to get high profit increases, business actors can make changes to packaging and raise prices. In this study also sought products that should be superior products using dynamic system simulation models and obtained results of research with corn chips into superior products. Furthermore, to find out how to predict the accuracy of the system is to use an average ratio and amplitude variation and the average yield obtained 0.96911% smaller than 5%, and the ratio of amplitude variation obtained results 17.0283% smaller than 30%.
