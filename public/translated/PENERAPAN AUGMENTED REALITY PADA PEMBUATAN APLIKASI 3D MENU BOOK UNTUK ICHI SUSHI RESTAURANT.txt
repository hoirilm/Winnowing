In restaurant service there are many different ways customers can order food and drinks. The most common way is for customers to call a waiter to place an order and then queue at the cashier. The problem is that when a large number of customers during meal time replace long hours just to place an order, then there must be another way that is faster to handle customer orders more easily and interactively so it is not boring. With the 3D application menu book ordering based on augmented reality created using Unity as the main component, Vuforia as an Augmented Reality Software Development Kit (SDK) and with Blender as software to produce 3D objects. By utilizing augmented reality technology that is integrated with the ordering system that is connected to the cashier, customers get maximum service including, food and drinks displayed to customers directly in the form of attractive 3D objects, information on ingredients and nutritional value of each menu, ordering and canceling realtime, making additional requests easier with chat features and ease of payment without the need to go to the cashier or call the waiter only with the billing process feature. The above features are expected to have an effect on improving service quality in terms of speed, convenience and are more interactive with customers. The result of this application is the realization of a way to order food and drinks at the Ichi Sushi restaurant that is faster, easier and interactive for customers. Based on the results of testing the speed and user experience, the application usage is faster than conventional ordering with a time difference of 58.89 seconds, and scores 661 points from 840 points on user experience testing, which means getting positive responses from customers.
