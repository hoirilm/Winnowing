Corn is one of the important crops, because corn is the second largest food commodity after rice. However, the demand for corn commodity in Indonesia is still not fulfilled, so it must import from other countries. Among the factors are pests and diseases that attack corn plants which cause low yields of corn. So that digital image processing techniques need to be applied to detect corn plant diseases early. The method that will be used is Fuzzy Color Histogram (FCH) for color extraction because the advantage of this method is that it is not too sensitive to noisy and light differences. As for the texture feature extraction, the method to be used is the Gray Level Run-Length Matrix (GLRLM) method. From the test data of 3,847 corn leaf images, the highest accuracy of the FCH method was 73.95%, for the GLRLM method it was 69.17%, while for the combination of the two the highest accuracy was 81.29%.
