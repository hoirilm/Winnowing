Village Government (kelurahan) is a government whose duty is to manage and have an obligation in serving the administration of residents at the village level. The administrative process of the population in the village of Larangan Dalam, Pamekasan, Madura is now still running manually, such as the process of filing or registering for residents who wish to submit a certificate, etc., is still quite difficult, because residents have to go to the village officer's house and are still being processed the day after the submission , and also the provision of files that are still ineffective because the file storage system is still fairly traditional by storing files in an ordner. Digital file storage as a copy of the original file is still managed manually which is then increasingly unstructured so it is less efficient. From the above problems, we will implement the Model View Controller (MVC) method for the process of building web-based applications and the Disdukcapil API to make it easier for village officials to obtain data from residents who carry out administrative processes by simply entering the NIK. The expectation of this research is that the web-based application of Village Administration Services can make it easier for village officials in the administrative processing of the villagers to make it more effective and efficient and structured.
