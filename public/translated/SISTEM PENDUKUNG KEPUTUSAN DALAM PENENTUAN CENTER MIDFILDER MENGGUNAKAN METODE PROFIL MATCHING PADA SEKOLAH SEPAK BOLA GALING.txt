CMF (Center Midfilder) or what is often called a midfielder is a soccer player whose job is to dominate the game in the middle of the field so that opponents are not easy to build attacks. Based on interviews with the Galing Soccer School coach, to become a Midfilder Center requires a number of good abilities in a number of ways, including: passing ability, shooting ability, stamina, control and dribbling. In addition, periodic assessments are also needed to ensure the ability of players. This is often the problem of a trainer because the scoring system is still manual so the data is not stored properly. Based on these problems to help the coach determine the position of the player needed a decision support system for defender recommendations. This system applies the Profile Matching method, so that it can provide recommendations for coaches to be applied to team play. The results of this study indicate that the Profile Matching method has a match level of up to 77%, which is obtained from the matching results of the calculation of the system with the trainer's point of view.
