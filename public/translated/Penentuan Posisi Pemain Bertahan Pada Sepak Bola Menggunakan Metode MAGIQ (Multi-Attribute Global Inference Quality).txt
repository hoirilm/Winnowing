In a soccer game a coach will determine the exact position of the player in the game by looking at the player's data. Sometimes the player's position does not match his abilities. Things like this that make it difficult for coaches to make the right decisions by assessing players objectively and not just using instinct in determining the position of players, especially defenders who become a bastion of defense for a team. Therefore, the presence of a decision support system technology determines the position of a defender in football for a coach is certainly very helpful to achieve maximum results in each match. The technology that the writer offers is to build a decision support system for the selection of defensive players 'positions derived from players' training data using the MAGIQ method. This system applies the MAGIQ (Multi-Attribute Global Inference Quality) method because in its weighting it ranks priorities for each factor and criteria and will be processed using the ROC (Rank Order Centroid) concept. The final result of the MAGIQ method itself is to produce an accuracy of 65% of the results of the system recommendations with the trainer's recommendations in the field.
