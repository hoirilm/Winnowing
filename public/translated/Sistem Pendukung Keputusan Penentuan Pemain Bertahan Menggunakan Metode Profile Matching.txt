Defender is a soccer player whose job is to protect the defense area of ​​a team from an opponent's attack. Based on the results of interviews with the El Faza Football School coach, to become a defender needed some good skills in various ways, including: the ability to feed (passing), the ability to head (heading), tackling and intercept. In addition, periodic assessments are also needed to ensure the ability of players. This is often the problem of a trainer because the scoring system is still manual so the data is not stored properly. Based on these problems to help the coach determine the position of the player needed a decision support system for defender recommendations. This system applies the Profile Matching method, so that it can provide recommendations to coaches to be applied to team play. The results of this study indicate that the Profile Matching method has a match level of up to 77%, which is obtained from the matching results of the calculation of the system with the trainer's point of view.
