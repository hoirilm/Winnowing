Mojokerto is one of the districts in East Java that has a variety of cultures, traditions, history and interesting tourism. The diversity has the potential to make Mojokerto a crowded place visited by tourists. The short time and the number of tourist destinations that want to be visited, making tourists have to schedule travel tours as effectively as possible. By implementing the Traveling Salesman Problem using the Greedy algorithm the application can provide information to the user about the most optimum route to several tourist sites, the user can determine the path to be traveled to overcome time efficiency. Greedy algorithm was chosen in the case of Traveling Salesman Porblem because this algorithm can provide the best solution for optimization problems with fast processing time. In addition to providing the most optimum route, the system also provides description information about tourist destinations, food places, and lodging needed by tourists. The results of the implementation of the Geographic Information System Using the Greedy Algorithm, obtained a good performance which can be seen from the accuracy of the accuracy of the route recommendations that are given quite in accordance with the recommendations given by the tourism department, and in the Greedy Algorithm programming is quite short with a time span of less than 1 second. The system is enough to help tourists in providing information about tourist destinations and shows the optimum route recommendations that can be seen from testing the user's response that scores 79.8%.
