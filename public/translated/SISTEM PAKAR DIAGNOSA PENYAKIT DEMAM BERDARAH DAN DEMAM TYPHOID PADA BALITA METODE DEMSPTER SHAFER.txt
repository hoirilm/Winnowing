Dengue Fever is a disease caused by dengue virus, which enters the human body through the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Typhus fever is a disease that occurs due to infection of the small intestine and sometimes also occurs in the bloodstream caused by Salmonella Typhil A, B and C. which enter through the digestive tract. Lack of sensitivity of parents to the symptoms of this disease make parents experience their own concerns, if health problems occur to toddlers. They are more entrusted to experts, regardless of the disorder is still in a low level or chronic. But with the ease of having experts there are sometimes weaknesses such as limited practice hours and the large number of patients who cause queues. So from this problem came the research to create an expert system to diagnose dengue fever and typhoid fever using the Dempster Shafer method where this method is non monotonous reasoning used to look for inconsistencies due to the addition or reduction of new facts that will change existing rules, so in this study it was concluded that the system's accuracy was 93%.
