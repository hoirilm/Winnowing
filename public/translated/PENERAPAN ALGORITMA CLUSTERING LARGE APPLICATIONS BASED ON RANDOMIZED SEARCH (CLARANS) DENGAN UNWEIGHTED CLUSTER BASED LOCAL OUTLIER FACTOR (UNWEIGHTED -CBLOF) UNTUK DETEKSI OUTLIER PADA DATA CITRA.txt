Outlier detection is one important research with the aim of finding data that has characteristics that are different from most other data. Outlier data in the dataset will affect the results of subsequent processes such as clustering and classification and sometimes the outlier also stores important information. This research begins with cutting important areas in the image that are done manually. After obtaining the image from the previous process, then color feature extraction is performed by first order statistical calculations namely mean, standard deviation, kurtosis and skewness and texture feature extraction using the Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) algorithm with a distance of 1 and 0o angle with features that are used are Angular Second Moment, Contras, Inverse Different Moment, Cluster Shade, and Cluster Prominence. After obtaining the features of each image then clustering using the Large Application Based Clustering Algorithm based on Randomized Search (CLARANS). After the clustering process, outlier detection is carried out using the unweighted-CBLOF algorithm. The dataset used in this study is the Supermarket Produce dataset with 2633 images as normal data and 50 outlier data taken from the Fruit Images dataset. The results of this study found the best features for outlier detection are using the Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture feature with an accuracy value of 85.612% and determining the number of classes in Clustering Large Applications Based on Randomized Search (CLARANS) which is increasingly uncertain increase the value of accuracy, so it needs to be tested with some number of classes to find the highest accuracy value.
