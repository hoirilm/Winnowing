Inventory control system (inventory logistics) is a system to find out inventory taking inventory of goods at a place. Because there are several problems, namely the difficulty in knowing information on demand, receipt, usage, and stock of consumables (BHP). This is because the data has not been stored in a good file and BHP inventory data management is still done manually (inventory card), in the process of supplying goods in warehouses to become a single user in carrying out inventory taking inventory BHP cannot be used for multiusers so that the service and Head Logistics cannot directly access BHP's stock taking report. Problems like this require a computerized and web-based system. The system development methodology used in this study is the waterfall method which includes, system analysis and engineering, needs analysis, design, programming, testing and maintenance. Inventory Logistic Management System has been deemed appropriate this can be seen in user satisfaction with an average survey value of 7.88 and a trial system that can run well. This application can significantly simplify the work distribution of goods distribution and making reports on the distribution of goods in the hospital environment. dr. H. Slamet Martodirdjo.
