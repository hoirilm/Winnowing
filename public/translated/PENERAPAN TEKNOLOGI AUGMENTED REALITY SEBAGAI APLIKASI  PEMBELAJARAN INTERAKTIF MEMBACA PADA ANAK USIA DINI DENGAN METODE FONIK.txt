Weak reading skills will cause early childhood learning interest to be low. One way to increase learning interest is to use interesting and interactive learning media. However, learning media that are commonly used are more directed towards printed learning media such as books, magazines and posters. The application of Augmented Reality technology was chosen because it can combine the virtual world and the real world in real time. Not only can display objects in two dimensions on paper, but also can display three-dimensional objects and make sounds. This can provide new experiences for young children in learning.
