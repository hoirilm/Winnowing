Recommendation system is a system used to recommend an item, for example recommending a film. The amount of film information on the internet makes it difficult for us to choose a film that suits your taste. For this reason, the film's recommendation system is needed by the community. This recommendation system requires rating data from movielens. The choice of method greatly influences the success of the system. The more accurate the system made, the better. The most popular method today is collaborative filtering, especially traditional collaborative filtering methods. However, this method has a scalability problem so to overcome this it is necessary to add a clustering method. In previous studies, some have used the method of k-means clustering and user-based collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering consists of user-based and item-based collaborative filtering. In another study mentioned that the item-based method is more accurate than the user-based collaborative filtering method. For this reason, this research uses k-means clustering and item-based collaborative filtering methods. The results of the trials conducted show that the method in this research is more accurate than user-based and item-based collaborative filtering. The percentage increase in the accuracy of the method studied by user-based is 113% whereas when compared with item-based collaborative filtering the increase in accuracy is 168%. The method studied is also more accurate than the combined method of user clustering and user-based collaborative filtering with an increase in accuracy of 27%.
