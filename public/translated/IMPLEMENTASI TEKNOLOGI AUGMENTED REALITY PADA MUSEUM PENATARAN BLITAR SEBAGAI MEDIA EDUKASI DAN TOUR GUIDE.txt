The Penataran Museum was previously named the Blitar Museum. Blitar Museum does not mean the museum in the true sense, but as a salvage hall for ancient objects in Blitar Regency. The development of Information Technology in the world has a very rapid growth rate, resulting in increasingly reduced communities to visit the museum. From these problems, we need a new idea to give another impression in studying the history of the Museum. One of the technologies that is currently increasing is the Augmented Reality technology. Augmented Reality technology is an AR tracking method that uses artificial markers. The Blitar Upgrading Museum Augmented Reality application is very efficient and can help in education and tour guides.
