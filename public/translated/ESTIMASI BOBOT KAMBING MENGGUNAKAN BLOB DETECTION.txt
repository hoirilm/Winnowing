Goat is one of the livestock used by humans, one of which is to be used as livestock for meat. Determination of goat prices is generally based on bargaining agreements between sellers and buyers not based on the weight and type of goat. Prices that are agreed upon usually use rough calculations. To measure the weight of farm animals can use conventional scales. Another way you can use the lambourne formula to find out the estimated weight of livestock. Therefore, to make it easier to measure the weight of goats we need a system that is able to estimate the weight of goats more efficiently. In this study the method used is BLOB (Binary Large Object). The amount of data used is 40 goat data with 3 image capture distances namely 50cm, 70cm and 90cm. The purpose of this study is to provide benefits for both the seller and buyer in determining the weight of the goat used to determine the appropriate price estimate for goats. Mann Whitney Test results in scenario I, there is a significant difference of 0.012 in the body length test, and the best test results using RMSE (Root Mean Squere Error) is in scenario III of 45.94, because the value is the lowest among the 3 trial scenarios.
