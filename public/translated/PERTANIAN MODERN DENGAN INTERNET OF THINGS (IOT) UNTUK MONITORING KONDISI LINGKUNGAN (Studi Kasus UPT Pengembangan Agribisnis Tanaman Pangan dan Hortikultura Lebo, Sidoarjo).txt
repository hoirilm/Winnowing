In modern agriculture the processing system grows
plants become more priority things that aim to
get quality plants as well as processing plants in a greenhouse. It is important to control the environment in the greenhouse which is adjusted to the case in the UPT for the development of food crops and holiculture Lebo Sidoarjo which has a greenhouse with a width of 40 meters, a length of 80 meters and a height of 16 meters. Besides the melon varieties planted in the greenhouse require temperatures of 25-30 Â° C and humidity ranging from 70% to 80%. With such conditions, the temperature and humidity in the room must be maintained stability. These problems are solved by utilizing an Android application-based Internet of Things (IoT) with data retrieval through the Arduino microcontroller sensor so that it can facilitate the farm in monitoring the temperature and humidity of a greenhouse room in real time remotely. From the testing that has been done, the resulting Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is 2.93 and humidity is 11.67. While testing on plants that have not yet produced results in temperature of 2.92 and humidity of 13.17. while in plants that have been fruiting and obtained a temperature of 2.97 and a humidity of 8.23. While the tests that have been carried out on plants in the morning obtained a temperature of 3.32 and a humidity of 12.43. While testing during the day obtained a temperature of 2.18 and a humidity of 10.35. From these results it can be concluded that the smaller Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is said to be more accurate than the larger results.
