Attacking players or who are often called strikers are players whose job is to score goals against the opponent. In placing the player in the position of an attacker a coach makes a subjective assessment so it requires a long time. Therefore we need a system that can help coaches in placing players as attackers. In this system producing qualified attacking players requires a number of criteria needed. Also needed a method in determining the position of the attacking players and in this study applying the profile matching method. This method is considered to be able to produce attacking players in accordance with the expected criteria. The calculation in this method compares the criteria of the player with the expected target criteria. So that you will get the same results as expected players. The results of this study are in the form of a system calculation, in which the player with the highest score is considered worthy of the position. From the system testing carried out the level of compatibility of the system results with the trainer's recommendation reached 57.14%.
