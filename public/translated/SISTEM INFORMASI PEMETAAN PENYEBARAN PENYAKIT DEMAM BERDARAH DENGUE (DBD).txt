Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) is an infectious disease that is endemic and often causes extraordinary events (KLB) in Indonesia. In Bangkalan, 2016 the Incidence Rate (IR) was recorded at 84.55 per 100,000 population and the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) was 1.11%. The figure is still above the national target of East Java Province 2016, namely IR? 49 per 100,000 population and CFR <1%. Therefore, we need a system that can provide information related to the mapping of the spread of dengue fever. To help the process of mapping the spread of dengue hemorrhagic fever, a technology is needed by applying the Geographic Information System (GIS) and the K-Means clustering method. This system can help health agencies to evaluate and monitor the spread of dengue fever and as an information medium that makes it easier for the public to know the distribution of dengue fever. Based on the test results using an average questionnaire all statements obtained a value of 4 in the agreed category which means the application of the effective K-Means clustering method was developed to support the performance of the health authorities in knowing the mapping of the spread of dengue in Bangkalan Regency. While the test results in determining the number of clusters using the silhouette coefficient method showed the best results 0.247 on the use of 6 clusters.
