Spreading fake news or hoax news is now increasingly unstoppable. The rapid growth of unverified websites has made this problem even worse. For this reason, it is necessary to have a system that can classify news based on text, which can be a filter media for those news. One of the most frequently used methods is the Na√Øve Bayes method which is known to be able to provide the best results for classification of false news in general. But it is still weak for news classification with certain topics. To overcome these shortcomings, in this study the system was made to classify news topics in advance using the Support Vector Machine method. The SVM method was chosen because it has been proven to have high accuracy for the classification of Indonesian language news. Then, to increase the accuracy of the results of this classification, a combination of TF-IDF and Mutual Information is also used as a feature selector. The results of performance measurements using the SVM and Naive Bayes methods for classification of false news or hoaxes with three predetermined categories namely health and food, politics, and figures, obtain an average value of accuracy = 81.33%, precission = 75.31%, and recall = 96%.
