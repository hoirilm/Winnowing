One method that is widely used for sentiment analysis is naive bayes. This method has good accuracy for sentiment classification and is efficient in computing. The analysis process will begin with data collection, then preprocessing, feature selection and classification modeling. Feature selection is done using the information gain method, by calculating the relationship of words to class and classification will be done by naïve Bayes, by calculating the probability of each word against the class. This study aims to determine how the performance of information gain and naïve bayes in sentiment analysis.
