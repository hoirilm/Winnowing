Various sports such as soccer, table tennis, badminton, etc. require that every sports news be grouped according to its branches. Therefore we need a way to classify sports news that has something in common. Grouping can be done by many methods. One method that can handle this problem is k-means clustering. K-means clustering is a grouping method that can work with large datasets efficiently. However, this method has problems when determining the initial cluster center. The final cluster results of k-means depend heavily on this initial determination. The cosine similairty method can help k-means clustering get a good cluster center. In this research, the grouping of Indonesian sports news is done using the k-means clustering method which has been modified with cosine similarity. The results obtained from the experiment are the best cluster center produced by the k-means method always changes, depending on the initial determination of the cluster center. After modifying the initial determination, the best cluster center tends to be constant, namely 4 cluster centers with an average accuracy value of 0.895.
