Anatomy learning uses a variety of methods, ranging from dissecting corpses to medical imaging techniques including X-ray, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. In general, the conventional method of studying anatomy is reading and memorization. The latest learning methods use multimedia technology by utilizing 3D objects. So that 3D objects can be explored interactively a motion sensor is used. One of the motion sensors is the Leap motion controller. 3D organ objects that can be explored using the user's hand gestures as input, are simple but nearly real learning methods. This is more value than conventional learning methods by reading and memorizing. In this study applying modern learning using integrated 3D objects Leap motion controller and displayed with virtual reality that was built using Unity3D. The development of Leap Motion Controller and Unity3D has produced interactive virtual learning media of the heart and lungs in humans. From the results of the performance test, the pointing feature is 100% successful. User experience test results show that importance points are 88.23%, valence points are 94.11%, control points are 97.05%. In conclusion, the material presented is delivered, the application is fun and not boring and the User can control the application freely.
