Batik is a craft that is a part of Indonesia's cultural heritage and was recognized by UNESCO in 2009. Batik is an attraction for buyers whose number of enthusiasts continues to increase from year to year. So many shops have popped up producing and selling batik products. Of the many shops that exist, not all of them have used a digital system in the ongoing business process. Some batik shops still use the transaction process and sales report entry in a simple way so that it takes up a lot of employee and owner time. In addition, the shop owner cannot estimate the amount of batik supply for the next few days from the results of data entry reports that enter simply. For this reason, it is necessary to have an application that can help in handling business processes in a batik shop and predict the number of batik that will be sold through the forecasting process. The application was built built and designed based on mobile with the implementation of the backpropagation neural network algorithm method. Backpropagation neural network algorithm is used to predict the number of batik that will be sold in the next 1 or 2 days. The results of the implementation of the backpropagation neural network method in predicting the number of batik requests, with the parameters used are learning rate 0.3, max iteration 1000 and max error 0.008363 resulting in an average accuracy of 50.94% with the smallest MSE value of 27.2%.
