The identification of attributes in the pedestrian image still has some fundamental obstacles. The camera's viewing angle, lighting, and image diversity are some of the obstacles encountered. A pretty good feature extraction method is needed. Therefore this study uses a combination of color and texture features. Color and texture-based feature extraction methods used are Color Histogram and Multi-Block Local Binary Pattern (MB-LBP) with the learning method used is Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost). The dataset used is the PEdesTrian Attribute (PETA) dataset which has a total data of 19000. This study aims to determine the effect when using only color or texture features with a combination of color and texture features. The result is that a combination of color and texture features can improve accuracy on several attributes. The highest accuracy is obtained by the flip attribute, with an accuracy reaching 76%.
