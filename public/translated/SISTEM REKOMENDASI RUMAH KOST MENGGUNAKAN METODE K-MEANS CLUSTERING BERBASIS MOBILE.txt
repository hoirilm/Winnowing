The University of Trunojoyo Madura is one of the many public universities that students are interested in continuing their studies to the undergraduate stage. Most of the new students come from out of town, so they are not familiar with the area around the University of Trunojoyo Madura. As the number of new arrivals increases, the need for boarding houses increases, therefore a boarding recommendation system is needed to make it easier for students to make choices according to their needs. The recommendation system that will be proposed in this study is to use the k-means clustering method to group data into different groups. In addition to using the k-means clustering method, the recommendation system provides a mobile-based system that is supported by google maps to make it easier for newcomer students to know the location around the University of Trunojoyo Madura. This research is expected to be able to recommend some items to students, boarding house items with several parameters such as boarding prices, boarding type, indoor bathroom, outdoor bathroom, refrigerator, kitchen, tv, fan, free wi-fi, free electricity and boarding distance to the University of Trunojoyo Madura. Based on the results of the implementation of the K-means Clustering method for boarding house recommendations obtained an accuracy of the percentage of system testing (P) obtained 81.67%, while the percentage of accuracy testing (Q) obtained 79.53%. That way the k-means clustering method has provided a fairly high level of accuracy and is feasible to be applied.
