The menu is a list of foods that have been equipped with their respective prices, which are provided and displayed to attract customers and provide value to the food offered. Food menu reservations sometimes experience problems with the lack of service in the ordering process due to crowded restaurant conditions. In addition there are more problems faced by customers when sometimes lazy to see a list of menus that are too many so that customers only order menus that are normally customers ordered and it is difficult for employees to record menu orders from customers when there are many customer orders due to crowded restaurant conditions. Therefore a restaurant system is needed that can handle problems related to the ordering process and also recommendations for selecting food menus. The results of the implementation of the Singular Value Decomposition method for food menu recommendations, produce an accuracy value with the F1-Score calculation results of 16.66% based on data testing with a reduction performed as much as Â¼ from each matrix.
