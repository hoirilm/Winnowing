Crimes can occur every day can be in the form of minor and serious crimes. Based on research that has been done, the police so far have only carried out the process of recording criminal reports without any further data processing to obtain useful solutions in handling crime and preventing crime. One of the forecasting methods that can be used to process crime data to produce predictions of crime, so that it can be used by the police for crime prevention facilities. One forecasting method used is the Trend Projection Method. This method of matching trend lines to historical data sets is then projected into the future with a period of time. This method requires information of previous years data so in this study the data collected 4 years earlier. With this forecasting method, the results of forecasting the value of a crime are almost close to the actual data even though several periods / months show very large differences. From the results of testing the system imposed on 5 districts for theft of motor vehicles obtained an accuracy value of 32%, 5 districts for theft of goods obtained an accuracy value of up to 16%, and 4 districts for animal theft obtained an accuracy value of 6%.
