Complaints that are ongoing at the Department of Public Works (PU) in Bangkalan Regency are still done manually, namely by visiting the office directly to submit a complaint. So that the agency requires a relatively long time in processing complaints from the public. For this reason, an android-based complaint application was built to facilitate the public in submitting complaints online to the Bangkalan District Public Works Office. This study uses the Rapid Application Development (RAD) method, which is a method of software development with an emphasis on short, short and fast development cycles. Based on 10 evaluator data, the results showed an average value of 85.83%, while the design and display values ​​were 81.78% so that it could be said that the application had achieved its intended purpose.
