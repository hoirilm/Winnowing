Motorized vehicles are a means of transportation that are quite popular, especially four-wheeled motor vehicles that are increasing. Public awareness and inefficient traffic systems have an impact on travel time in travel, a more severe impact that is the paralysis of traffic in big cities. From these problems, this research detects the number plate location using the Harris Corner method and the number plate character segmentation using Otsu Threshold as an effort to implement an intelligent traffic system. By using test data of 100 motorized vehicle images, the results of the detection of location of number plates using Harris Corner by 90%, while the segmentation of number plate characters using the Otsu Threshold method has an accuracy of 84.14%. Both have quite high accuracy and can be an option to avoid traffic paralysis, especially at the toll entrance.
