Diabetes is a disease that can attack human organs, especially vision function. Visual dysfunction caused by diabetes is known as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). The eye is the main organ of the function of vision, several organs in the eye can be used to analyze diseases including diabetes retinopathy. Optic disc (OD) is the central meeting of the eye nerve. The location of OD in the fundus image is easily observed because OD has a sharper contrast than other features, namely exudate which is a symptom of DR that appears in the form of patches on the eyes. In this study, to determine OD segmentation there are two stages, namely preprocessing and segmentation. In the preprocessing stage, converting an RGB image into a grayscale image using feature extraction based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the grayscale PCA value is taken from the eigen vector value based on the largest eigen value. Grayscale PCA image results obtained have better and sharper contrast in presenting optical disk objects. Then the removal of blood vessels using Morphology Operator. At the segmentation stage, the Otsu Thresholding method is used to determine the segmentation threshold value. This method has been tested on a Messidor database consisting of 100 fundus images. With this database, obtained an average accuracy of 99.11%, sensitivity 81.298%, and specificity of 99.412%.
