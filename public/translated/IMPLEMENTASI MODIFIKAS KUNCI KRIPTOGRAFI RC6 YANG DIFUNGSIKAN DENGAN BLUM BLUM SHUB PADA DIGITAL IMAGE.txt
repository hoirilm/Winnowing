Image is a media that provides more information than information presented in writing. Therefore an application is needed to secure an image so that the image cannot be seen by unauthorized viewers. One such security application is to use cryptography with the RC6 method. Input is in the form of a digital image, then the image is encrypted and decrypted using the ordinary RC6 algorithm, and then the encryption and decryption process is performed as a comparison by using the RC6 algorithm with a modified key. Modified keys are keys that function with Blum Blum Shub. RC6 algorithm using ordinary keys has good performance, it can be seen from the Avalanche Effect value between 49.9167% and the Avalanche Effect value from the modification of the RC6 key that is 50.0808%. The average encryption-decryption time on RC6 regular keys is 0.8086542 and 0.7348798 seconds and the average encryption-decryption time for modification of RC6 keys is 0.695695 seconds and 0.6764988 seconds. While the average RCN key generated PSNR is 8.24174 and the RC6 key modification PSNR is 8.08961. In general, the Avalanche Effect and the encryption and decryption time on RC6 key modification are better than normal RC6 of 0.1641% and encryption-decryption of 0.1129592 seconds and 0.058381 seconds. While PSNR performance is better using ordinary RC6 keys.
