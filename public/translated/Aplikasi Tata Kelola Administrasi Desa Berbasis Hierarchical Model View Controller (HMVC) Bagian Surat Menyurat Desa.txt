In managing the administration of village correspondence is still done manually which will slow down the performance of agencies. From the existing problems, the application is needed so that the problem can be resolved. To facilitate the development of correspondence in the administration of correspondence, this application uses the concept of the Hierarchical Model View Controller. The application of HMVC was chosen because it has the advantages to be gained, among others, the development of large software that is easy to do, add or subtract code and use modularization techniques. This application is a development of the existing Government Administration Application that uses the concept of a Hierarchical Model View Controller, based on PERMENDAGRI No. 47 of 2016. Based on the results of the trial run of the HMVC-based correspondence administration application after testing the application, it was concluded that making this application helps village officials in the process of providing correspondence in an efficient and effective manner to the community. And from the results of testing the questionnaire that has been done that is 82.4% for the application and for the accuracy rate obtained 81.9% so it is quite accurate, so the results of the two questionnaires have a good level of confidence and consistency.
