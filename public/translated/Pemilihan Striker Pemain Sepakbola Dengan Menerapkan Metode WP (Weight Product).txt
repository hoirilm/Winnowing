Striker is a player who is in the front row and dealing directly with the opposing defender, his job is to put the ball into the opponent's goal. A striker must have good shooting or kick accuracy. Not only that, a striker must also be able to open up the space to shoot and create good opportunities for himself so he can score goals, for that requires a good foresight from a football coach in terms of choosing a striker. A coach in choosing a striker does not just rely on his observations, but must see significant data records that can support the decision, so a decision support system is needed to resolve the problem. This system applies the WP (Weight Product) method whose aim is to provide recommendations to the coach for each player's position selection, as well as knowing the needs of which team of players is suitable to be placed in the striker position. From the results of research WP (Weight Product) can be implemented in the striker selection system and has an accuracy value of 55% obtained from the comparison between the results of the calculation of the system with the trainer's recommendation data.
