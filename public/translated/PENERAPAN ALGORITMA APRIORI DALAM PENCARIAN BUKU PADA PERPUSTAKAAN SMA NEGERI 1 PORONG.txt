Porong Public High School 1 Library has various collections of books to support teaching and learning activities. In the activity of borrowing books, students usually ask friends who have borrowed certain subject books to get references on what books are usually borrowed so that it makes finding books in the library easier. This research can apply and develop a decision support system that is able to provide information to library visitors about book recommendations that can be borrowed. This study uses a priori algorithm to get the rules that are used as recommendations. The results of experiments that have been carried out with a priori algorithm, from the test scenarios that have been concluded, the greater the minimum value of support and the minimum confident value produces fewer rules and the time required to obtain rules is also shorter. The results were obtained from the test results with the provisions of suppot values ​​3, 4, 5 and 6 with a 70% confident value in getting a response time of 0.0200012 (support 6) seconds, response time 0.00330021 seconds (support 5), response time 0.00340021 seconds (support 4) , response time 0.0760038 seconds (support 3).
