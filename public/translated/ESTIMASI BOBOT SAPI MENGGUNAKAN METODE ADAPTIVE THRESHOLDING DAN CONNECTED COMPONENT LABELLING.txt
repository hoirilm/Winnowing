The introduction of objects in the image provides a new alternative to find out the weight of cows with Image Processing. Image Processing can help speed up the identification of a cow's weight. In image processing, the image obtained will be processed in such a way. This research uses adaptive thresholding and Connected Component Labeling (CCL) methods. The results of image segmentation using thresholding still have noise so a CCL method is needed to remove noise in the image. The dataset used for training was a cow image dataset. Cow dataset has an image of 120 consisting of 3 distances. The study aims to find out how accurate the weight estimation of cattle using the adaptive thresholding method and CCL, both methods are good enough for this research. The results obtained in this study are the results of good image segmentation, can increase the level of accuracy. Measurement of accuracy using the best RMSE in this study is equal to 20,354 at a distance of 150 cm.
