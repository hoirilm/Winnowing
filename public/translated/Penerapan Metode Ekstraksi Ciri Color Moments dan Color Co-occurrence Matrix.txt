The process of searching for image information based on text is not efficient. To streamline image search you can use image queries (Content Based Image). This study uses two methods of color feature extraction namely the color moments and color co-occurrence matrix methods. As for calculating the similarity of image queries with images in the database using Euclidean Distance. The level of accuracy is measured using Precission and Recall. The dataset used in this study is the Wang dataset with 1000 images. The dataset is divided into 2 parts, 30% (300 images) as testing data and 70% (700 images) as training data. In this study, there were 3 trial scenarios, namely only the Color Moments, Color Co-occurrence Matrix and the combination of Color Moments and Color Co-occurrence Matrix. In this research, the highest accuracy value is obtained by combining feature extraction using Color Moments and Color Co-occurrence Matrix to get a Precision value of 48% and a Recall value of 21%.
